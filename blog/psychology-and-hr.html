              <p class="paragraph-article">Reading our blog about the People & Organization Team at Alasco, you might have come to the conclusion that we all have different backgrounds and different stories on how we started to work in Human Resources. This blog is about my story and how I decided to use my psychology skills in the P&O Team at Alasco.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">I am Pia, third year psychology student at the University of Regensburg and  part of the Alasco P&O team since September 2020. Before joining Alasco as a working student I basically had zero experience in working in HR, but I was curious to see how much of my studies could be transferred into my work here at Alasco. </p>

              <h2>My journey to Alasco</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-article">I began to study Psychology more than two years ago, not knowing what to do afterwards. It wasn’t the career afterwards that excited me, but learning about the humans, our behaviour and thoughts.  There are so many possibilities as a psychologist - not only working as a therapist but also studying human behaviour or understanding employees in a workplace. </p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">The idea of doing something that connects psychology and work, a big part of our daily lives,  developed through time. The more seminars and lectures I visited, the more I was interested in doing something outside the clinical field. And what is more exciting than to accompany people in their career (path) and build up a working environment where people feel comfortable to work in? </p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">That is why I applied as Working Student HR at Alasco in June 2020. I was excited about how the theory that I had previously learned in university could be applied in an actual company.</p>

              <h2>Psychology and work</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-article">The explanation of what psychology has to do with work and business is pretty simple: Psychologists try to describe, analyse and explain human experience and behaviour. In the interaction of people and work, humans react very individually to different stimuli. Therefore it is not only interesting how work can change people but also how people change different aspects of their work.</p>

              <h2>My three favorite learnings - The importance of developing employees, regular check ins and employee engagement.</h2>
              <p class="paragraph-article">Development is an ongoing process that should not be underestimated</p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">At Alasco we put a lot of focus on the development of our employees and their professional and personal growth. We want to understand how they identify and see themselves in their role at Alasco and what ambitions or talents they have. Based on that, the P&O Team and their supervisors try to find the right ways and initiatives to strengthen their abilities and help them grow within their position. Development thereby is an ongoing process and both employee and supervisor benefit and grow during this time. For me as an aspiring psychologist this has made me even more aware of how important the support of an HR team can be in keeping employees happy with their work. Only if you try to let your employees develop in their position the way they want to, you can avoid a high turnover.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">An important task in psychology is analyzing and improving organizational and work structures. If an employer achieves to keep on track of the needs of their employees, it will stay the attractive employer that he aims for. During my time at Alasco I learned how effective regular check-ins and continuous conversations between employee and supervisor can be, even though it might seem like an inefficient use of time.  But it’s worth it! Through different actions like 1:1, weekly all-hands meetings and regular feedback talks the supervisors continuously grasp the mood of the Alascians and identify possible concerns or wishes they might have. It’s great to see how continuous communication helps to find solutions faster and to keep job satisfaction high.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">Job satisfaction is also a big part of my third learning: How to evaluate employee engagement. It is associated with multiple aspects such as the feeling of psychological safety, work motivation and  a higher total satisfaction. In my studies I am very used to conducting and evaluating surveys that carefully have to be designed not to set biases etc. Last year we designed the first Alasco engagement survey to find out what the employees might be missing in their workplace, how they felt about their work and what we as P&O team could do to foster a happy work atmosphere. It was especially interesting to see how the team was feeling about working from home and  how they dealt with the pandemic. We were able to draw valuable conclusions from the survey and evolve concepts for topics such as leadership and further development and motivation during the ongoing lockdown.</p>

              <p class="paragraph-article">At university we are taught through a handful of studies how important the job of psychologists is not only in a clinical context but in any context with people. However, I could only really convince myself of this fact by starting my job at Alasco. Through practice, the theory from my studies becomes more tangible and I was already able to apply a number of methods from my studies. I think it is even more important that companies recognise the importance of occupational psychologists and a supportive HR team in general and establish them in their organisations in order to create a good basis for the success of the company. I am really looking forward to when Psychologists in HR departments are the rule instead of the exception. Until then, I am curious about the topics and things that are left to learn and how I personally can contribute to Alasco and its success.</p>
