                            <p class="paragraph-article">What is life at Alasco like? To answer this question we started
                                to ask Alascians to describe their journey and tell a bit about their everyday life. In
                                this blogpost, Aleksandra shares her story. Joining us in fall of 2020 Aleksandra has
                                become an important part of our Sales Development Team. Read more about her journey and
                                what life as SDR at Alasco can look like.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">After my studies and a longer travel to South America, my
                                application process for a full-time position took longer than expected due to COVID-19
                                and the first lockdown. After several experiences with different companies during
                                lockdown, where the application processes were paused or cancelled at all, I was
                                prepared for any kind of interview procedures when applying for Alasco. To my big
                                surprise, the whole process lasted only two weeks and I was able to start right away.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">So here I am, 8 months later, remembering my first day at
                                Alasco, where I didn’t know what to expect and thinking about how my daily doing will
                                look like, I want to give you a small insight on where my journey has brought me so far
                                and how my daily work looks like.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">When applying for the position as a Sales Development
                                Representative (SDR) and then preparing for my interviews, I caught myself thinking
                                about so many different aspects of this position, that in the end, it seemed to be a
                                unique opportunity for me not only to start a career in a fast growing startup, but also
                                to combine my studies, interests and personal development goals in one position. But
                                I’ll come to that in more detail in a minute.</p>
                            <h1>First of all, let’s have a closer look at the daily tasks of a SDR.</h1>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">A normal day starts around 9 am with checking my emails and our
                                CRM (Customer-Relationship-Management) tool for the daily tasks. Sometimes there are so
                                many that you have to check twice, if the number shown is really correct :). Just joking
                                - no reason to be scared - more tasks mean of course more potential customers to engage
                                in using Alasco!</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">After a small morning check-in with my POD (that’s how we call
                                our cross-functional team depending on different customer groups consisting of SDRs,
                                Account Executives and Customer Success Managers), I work through my email and calling
                                tasks, to make the potential customers aware of Alasco and our solution.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">The exchange with potential customers in general makes up a
                                large part of my day - we reach out to them, talk to them, qualify them and search for
                                solutions in other internal teams to solve special requests they might have.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">Both, the functional and the cross-functional team have slack
                                channels to communicate, share news or funny pictures during the day. This really helps
                                a lot, especially when working remote, to learn from each other and sometimes just for
                                having a good laugh together!</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">Besides internal and customer meetings, in the afternoon I
                                usually search for new interesting prospects to reach out for.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">On a weekly basis we have kickoffs with the team and our team
                                lead, where we discuss the week ahead and always brainstorm together for improvements of
                                the actual process.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">During home office times, the routine of having a quick
                                check-out in the evening with the SDR team, personally for me, turned out to be a very
                                important part of the day to get blockers removed in a very efficient way. And I
                                wouldn’t like to miss the daily  “Let’s call it a day”- statement of our team lead
                                anymore to really start my free evening :)</p>
                            <h1>But what does it actually mean to be a SDR at Alasco?</h1>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">Having a management and technology background, I was lacking
                                any knowledge or experience in the PropTech industry - a fact I was truly worried about
                                in my first days at Alasco.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">But from the first day on, everyone at Alasco helped a lot to
                                get me on track. The learning curve is immense - you have meetings with Customer
                                Success, Sales, Product which continue on a daily basis within the POD structure.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">And of course - you learn from the customers. As a SDR you are
                                at the front line of the whole sales process and responsible for the attraction of new
                                leads. Every customer call shows you a new perspective of the industry and gives you
                                very valuable insights in their working processes.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">In the end - every customer goes through our hands, which makes
                                oneself feel truly proud when you see the direct influence of your work on the overall
                                company goals with regard to revenue.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">The interaction with all kinds of leads, doesn’t only make you
                                become an expert in the industry, but also teaches you to get along with very different
                                kinds of people and situations. I believe that this is an important experience, which
                                might not only be helpful in one’s future career path but also in personal life to
                                handle any kind of situation.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">When starting at Alasco I barely had Sales experience and
                                wouldn’t call myself a typical Sales person by definition. But Alasco supports your
                                personal and professional development to become a real A-player in what you do.
                                Coachings with external mentors or an annual development budget of 2.000 EUR and 3 extra
                                days gives you a lot of space for your personal improvement.</p>
                            <h1>Last, but not least - what do I like most about my job as a SDR?</h1>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">What makes me really happy in a job is to understand problems
                                and find solutions for our potential customers. By engaging with the leads every day,
                                you learn a lot about the difficulties of digitization and the challenges they face in
                                optimizing their processes.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">On the one hand, it’s a lot of fun to show them how easy their
                                challenges can be solved with software and on the other hand, there is still so much
                                potential in the construction industry for digitization, that most of the time they are
                                really thankful for reaching out to them.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">And of course our Barista coffee machine at the office :)</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-article">To sum up, with the position as a SDR at Alasco I found the
                                perfect environment for me to start my career with a lot of room for personal and
                                professional development.</p>
